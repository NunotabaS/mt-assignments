the romance in communications technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :

nothing new : two justices attend the event of federalists for many years already .

however , the sheer intimacy scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as the company to big financial interests , was enough signal to the activists ethics in government .
" judge wined and dined at the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas barely pay attention to the critics who say they are very eager to mix business with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like the society of federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that the justice elena kagan raises ethical issue , not scalia and thomas .
her critics demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case , because she was too engaged in protection of the law then to be impartial now .

pri ruled mexico for seven decades until losing presidency in 2000 .
calderon , a candidate from the national action party , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to recognize вальехо won .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
in the michoacan has long reigned supreme drug cartels that specialize in marijuana , heroin and метамфетаминах .

раджат naga , the managing director of adb 's office in manila , said the two most emerging big economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with international monetary fund or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia , could be up to some extent protected , but it cannot be immune " .
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
in the europe debt crisis has given rise to fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and has led to calls for leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and the reduction of foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that makes no sense for developing economies like india to assist rich europeans , when they are faced with its own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the field to fight in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make a cut , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will do serious damage to readiness . "
" though not directly affected military funding in overseas contingency operations секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the major budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff personnel will cut that lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from cuts or budget compromise that will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without kernel .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could also face obstacles , including those who have already been testing and some in the early stages of planning .
stop further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and address potential threats from china and other adversaries .
a cursory glance at recent headlines goes to show how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in daily life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign - related укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on tests in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , send message that lying and cheating are acceptable .
for one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers people солгали three times for the first ten minutes of each other .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to identify lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
should not to conclude from this that liars difficult to see and difficult to expose .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the позой , a laugh , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , change their position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i had no sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complicated matter entirely .
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there 's no magical tools to identify the lies , but the skill can detect deception .

we are happy our удачам and we are very encouraged by the fact that we can continue making music together .

does that mean for you to be part of the heyday of grunge ?
we are good friends with the guys from soundgarden , alice in chains and mudhoney .
one group from one town appears from time to time , but it is far more oddly , when five or ten groups appear in the same time in the same city .
i still like to play with some of them from time to time .
also very strange that a group of like your remained together in a single and the same part of such a long time .
firstly , i think we are lucky that we are still alive , and secondly , we care about others .
we trust each other 's music , and could not be better .
we care about is not to be too long on the tour , because it is easy to get the game in big crowds and the people who enjoy your music .
how do you remember another project that manother love bone ?
we were a group of almost three years and have not released one album , up to the death of andy ( andrew woods ) .
it was a remarkable man , and we skuchaem on it .
it 's true that you are familiar with her job , especially eddie веддера , and therefore you have chosen to open it ?
why do you constantly change the words in the yellow ledbetter at concerts ?
he sings it and i think that he uses the first thing that comes in his head .
so many of them that i can talk all day on the басистах , where i love .
i think we all feel some гранж alienated from the rest of the word .
start your music was more grim , but now it has become a more positive .
it 's interesting , because i think , there are a few songs on this album that may seem easier , but there are songs like the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit more .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some sort of injury and you lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your art and music , and the two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mix of the best quality , sustained to the impacts of environmental and temperature .
in his lectures technological view of the pits , read as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen for mix with those of close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular mass , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behavior .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in the day , depending on the environmental conditions and temperatures , specializing in chemical engineering said .

as part of the pavement , which will be to receive and distribute these efforts , the wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and must take account of the material from which he is .
when the earth crude , water penetrates the surface and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all sections of the cover , and therefore education yam .
also a member of the national researchers explained that the transport system load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer should always be connected to cover transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent frequent appearance of the pits .
