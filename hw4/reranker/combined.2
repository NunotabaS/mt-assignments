moreover , conservatives argue that the justice elena kagan raises ethical issue , not scalia and thomas .
her critics demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case , because she was too engaged in protection of the law then to be impartial now .

president felipe calderon 's sister , it seems , made his bid for the governor of michoacan during the fierce state elections , and it said on monday that the traffickers have helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for the michoacan , but also for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon in радиоинтервью the next day after the sunday vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades until losing presidency in 2000 .
calderon , the national action party candidate , or ipa , by her brother , refused to recognize the vallejo win .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
in the michoacan has long reigned supreme drug cartels that specialize in marijuana , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked election in michoacan , a victory would give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , the managing director of adb 's office in manila , said the two most emerging big economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with international monetary fund or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia , could be up to some extent protected , but it cannot be immune " .
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
developing in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and has led to calls for major developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and the reduction of foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for developing economies like india help wealthy europeans , when they face their own deep economic problems .
" at some point they recognize that the greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be taken well , " he said .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the field to fight in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make a cut , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes would undermine credibility of those who support our army and will damage readiness . "
" though not directly affected military funding in overseas contingency operations секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the major budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff personnel will be cut , would lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release from the pentagon cuts that will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without kernel .
" it is a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could also face obstacles , including those who have already been testing and some in the early stages of planning .
stop further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and address potential threats from china and other adversaries .
a cursory glance at recent headlines goes to show how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in daily life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards has been charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , connected with укрывательством fornication .
stories of fraud on tests in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , send message that lying and cheating are acceptable .
for one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that unfamiliar people солгали three times for the first 10 minutes meeting with one another .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to identify lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
should not to conclude from this that liars difficult to see and difficult to expose .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the позой , a laugh , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , change their position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complicated matter .
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there 's no magical tools to identify the lies , but the skill can detect deception .

we are happy our удачам and we are very encouraged by the fact that we can continue making music together .
we are happy to go to places in the world , where we always wanted to go .
does that mean for you to be part of the heyday of grunge ?
we are good friends with the guys from soundgarden , alice in chains and mudhoney .

i think we all feel some гранж alienated from the rest of the word .
start your music was more grim , but now it has become a more positive .
it 's interesting , as i think , in an album there are a few songs that may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a little bit of positively .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some injury and you lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and these two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mix of the best quality , sustained to the impacts of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture as part of the technology at the pit , international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to bitumen production , but with the best resistance , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in the day , depending on the environmental conditions and temperatures , specializing in chemical engineering said .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of the vehicles and latch efforts , it helps to be very well on the road to cover .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , is the last layer , called a wear layer , which made of small stone , sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , wear layer also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , of which he is .
when the earth crude , water into the coverage and finds it difficult to go from there , it causes размягчение all sectors of the covers and , therefore , education , yam .

if there is a theme , the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion , or under the influence of emotion , this energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an excuse for reflections on share and place , holding nuclear energy .
france must build up its opinion on the objective facts and on rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing deficit fossil resources to continue electricity production time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that 's why germany remains one of them in his decision to give up nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
while the german model based on renewable energy , sometimes for example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she gets 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices respectively on 65 % and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment at the national territory , the french company benefit from the cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that cannot be moved in another industry .

for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three major incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy .

both parties see the immigration burden to the french economy and to french society .
in his program francois hollande limited platitudes , saying that " working together will solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of impact of immigrants based on the view that they could replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wage local workers .

these teeth that was used to scare immigrants , made exactly the opposite effect .
